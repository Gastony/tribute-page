     <h3>Here's a time line of Nyerere's life:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><p><strong>1922</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Born in Butiama, then in the British colony of Tanganyika</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1934</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Nyerere began his education at the Native Administration School in Mwisenge, Musoma</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1942</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp; during Nyerere's final year at Tabora, his father died; the school refused his request to return home for the funeral</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1943</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Nyerere started his college education  at Makerere College in the Ugandan city of Kampala</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1946</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp; he attended the organisation's conference in Dar es Salaam, where the TAA officially declared itself committed to supporting independence for Tanganyika</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1949</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;He applied for funding from the Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme and was initially unsuccessful, although succeeded on his second attempt</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1949</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Started his studies at the University of Edinburgh, he began with a short course in chemistry and physics and also passed Higher English in the Scottish Universities Preliminary Examination.[74] In October 1949 he was accepted for entry to study for a Master of Arts degree at the University of Edinburgh's Faculty of Arts; his was an Ordinary Degree of Master of Arts which, in contrast to common uses of the term "Master of Arts", was considered an undergraduate rather than postgraduate degree, the equivalent of a Bachelor of Arts in most English universities.</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1953</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp; he was elected president of the Tanganyika African Association (TAA).</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1954</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Nyerere, assisted by Oscar Kambona, transformed the TAA into a new political party, the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU)</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1959</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Nyerere visited Edinburgh.</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1960</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;he attended a conference of independent African states in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at which he presented a paper calling for the formation of an East African Federation. He suggested that Tanganyika could delay its attainment of independence from the British Empire until neighbouring Kenya and Uganda were able to do the same.</p></li>
       <li><p><strong>1961</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Tanganyika gained independence, an event marked by a ceremony at National Stadium.</li>
       <li><strong>1999</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Dead aged 77</p></li>
